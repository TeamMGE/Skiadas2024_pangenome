# Pangenome graph analysis
Parse a pangenome graph and overlap given annotations of genes and TEs for every sample in the graph. For all genes, define orthogroups based on their synteny on the pangenome graph. Plot the variation for the whole pangenome and for repeats at the nucleotide level, and for all genes and a given subset of genes at the orthogroup level.
